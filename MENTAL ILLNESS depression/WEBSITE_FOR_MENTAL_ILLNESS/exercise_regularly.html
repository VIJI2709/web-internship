		It means engaging in physical activity on a consistent and frequent basis as part of a routine or lifestyle.

		Regular exercise can have a positive impact on individuals facing depression. While exercise is not a cure for depression, incorporating it into one's routine can contribute to overall mental well-being.
	</p>
	<p>
		Engaging in physical activity can lead to an immediate improvement in mood. The sense of accomplishment and the release of neurotransmitters during exercise can counteract feelings of despair and helplessness.
	</p>
	<p>
		Exercise is known to reduce stress hormones and lower anxiety levels. Regular physical activity provides a healthy outlet for managing stress, potentially decreasing symptoms associated with depression.
