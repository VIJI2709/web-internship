			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">1. Feelings with a Shout.</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
				Expressing your emotions to a trusted friend is a helpful way to cope with depression. However, there's an even more liberating approach: allowing yourself to scream at the top of your lungs. While childhood lessons may have emphasized using an "inside voice," as an adult, you have the autonomy to set your own rules. If you're contending with bottled-up frustrations and depression, giving yourself the freedom to release those emotions through screaming can be a powerful and cathartic experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				This doesn't imply instilling fear in others, creating a sense of unease around you. We're discussing a constructive outlet for emotions in a controlled setting. The more you resist depression, the more it may intensify. Instead, acknowledge depression as a facet of your life and then release it. Whether it's screaming, punching a pillow, stomping your feet, or pounding your chest, do whatever aids in expressing and letting go of these emotions.

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">3.End your relationship with caffeine.</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
				Indulging in a cup of coffee, chocolate, or an ice-cold Coke may offer momentary relief, but if caffeine is your preferred coping mechanism, it could potentially exacerbate your depression.
			</p>
			<p>
				Caffeine gives the nervous system a jolt, which can boost energy levels. But when under pressure, this nervous energy can induce an anxiety 
				attack. Now, the idea of giving up your favorite caffeinated beverage might raise your heart rate and induce depression as you read this, but you 
				do not have to give up caffeine completely. It is all about moderation.
			</p>
			<p>
			Rather than four cups of coffee a day, scale back to one or two normal-sized cups a day â€”normal as in 8 ounces, not 16 or 32 ounces. Give it a test 
			run and see how you feel. As you wean yourself, slowly introduce other beverages into your diet such as decaffeinated herbal tea, which can calm your 
			mind and nerves.
			</p>

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">5. Feel comfortable saying no.</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Your plate has its limits, and if you burden yourself with everyone else's personal issues, your anxiety may intensify. While the saying goes, "There is more happiness in giving than receiving," it doesn't imply that you should passively allow others to encroach upon your time.
			</p>
			<p>
			Whether you are driving someone around on errands, picking up their kids from school, or lending an ear about their problems, you will have little strength 
			to care for your personal affairs if you spend almost all your energy caring for others. This doesn't mean you should never help anyone, but know your 
			limitations, and do not be afraid to say "no" when you need to.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="card slide-in-left">
			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">7. Provide yourself with a way out.</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
			Sometimes, depression is due to feeling out of control. You can't always be in the driver seat of your life, but you can take steps to identify your 
			triggers and cope with circumstances that cause depression. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Does the thought of going into a social situation or meeting new people make you want to jump off a bridge? As everyone at a party engages in exciting 
			conversations, maybe you see yourself holding up the wall and counting down the seconds until you are put out of your misery. You drove with friends and 
			cannot leave, so you spend the entire night looking like the punchbowl attendant. It is this fear that makes you decline invitations and sleep through the 
			weekends. 
			</p>
			<p>
			But what if you had an exit strategy in place before leaving the house? For example, instead of carpooling with your party animal friends, you could 
			drive yourself. This way, you can leave if your anxiety starts to build and you can't handle another minute of awkward interactions. The more in control
			you feel, the less depression you'll have.

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">2.Engage in physical activity.</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
				The prospect of exercising may be the last thing on your mind when you're feeling overwhelmed. Concerns about post-workout soreness or potential overexertion might cross your thoughts. However, the truth is that exercise stands as one of the most effective natural solutions for alleviating depression.
			</p>
			<p>
			Physical activity raises endorphins and serotonin levels to help you feel better emotionally. And when you feel better on the inside, your 
			entire outlook improves. And because your brain cannot equally focus on two things at once, exercise can also take your mind off your problems. 
			Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity three to five days a week. Do not think you have to struggle through a painful workout. 
			Any type of movement is good, so put on your favorite jam and move around the house. Or grab a mat and break out into your favorite yoga poses.

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">4. Give yourself a bedtime</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
				In the midst of your hectic schedule, is there really any room for sleep? Some individuals who prioritize work boast about getting by with only three or four hours of sleep each night, as if suggesting, "I am more determined and committed than everyone else." Regardless of what you may convince yourself, you are not a robot. Adequate sleep is essential for proper human functioning. Unless you recently beamed in from a neighboring planet, this fundamental need applies to you as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether you grapple with insomnia, intentionally restrict your sleep duration, or proudly identify as a night owl, persistent sleep deprivation renders you more vulnerable to anxiety. Extend a favor to yourself (and those in your vicinity) by ensuring you get a solid eight to nine hours of sleep every night. Establishing a bedtime routine, such as reading a book or engaging in a relaxing activity before sleep, can significantly enhance your preparedness for a restful night. Improved sleep quality not only contributes to better mornings but also enhances overall well-being.
			</p>

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">6. Make sure not to skip meals.</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
				When depression induces nausea, the idea of consuming food may be as unappealing as eating dirt. However, skipping meals can exacerbate depression. Not eating causes a drop in blood sugar, triggering the release of cortisol, a stress hormone. While cortisol can enhance performance under pressure, it may worsen feelings of depression, especially if you are already susceptible to it.
			</p>
			<p>
			The fact that you need to eat does not justify stuffing just anything in your mouth, so this is not an excuse to overindulge in sugar and junk food. Sugar
			does not cause depression, but a sugar rush can cause physical symptoms of depression, such as nervousness and shaking. And if you begin to obsess over a
			reaction to sugar, you could have an out-all panic attack. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Incorporate more lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats into your diet. Eat five to six small meals throughout the day, and avoid or limit
			your intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates.
			</p>

			<h3 style="color: #663acb; font-size: 25px;">8. Embrace the present moment.</h3>
			<p style="text-indent: 40px;">
				Apart from the words on this page, what occupies your thoughts at this moment? Are concerns about an upcoming meeting next week preoccupying your mind? Do financial goals contribute to your current stress? Perhaps you find yourself fixating on the idea of being a good parent, even though you currently have no children and no imminent plans for conception.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you have just uncovered part of the problem. Like many others with anxiety disorders, you have trouble 
			living in the moment. Instead of worrying about today, you're already thinking about tomorrow's problems. And depending on the severity of your depression,
			you might be stressing about yesterday's mistakes. 
			</p>
			<p>
			You cannot control the future, and you cannot borrow a time machine and change the past, so here is a thought: Take each day as it comes. Not to say you 
			can't be proactive and head off problems. But do not put too much focus on what has been and what will be that you create depression for yourself.
			Mindfulness and meditation are rooted in living in the moment and have been proven to ease depression. Try practicing for a few minutes a day and increase 
			the duration over time. The best part? You can do it anywhere: in bed, at your work desk, or even on the commute home.
